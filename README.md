# Burger Week Promo

This is a landing page for a "Burger Week" promotion page.  
This project was received as home assignment, to code a landing page from scratch based on an image (the original image can be found at the bottom).  
This project should test HTML, CSS and JS skills.

## The requirements

- Use any Google font that you want.
- The landing page must be responsive (from 320px to 1920px).
- Use live text on tabs with images.
- Use carousel (owl or slick) on the slides section.
- No need for pixel perfect.

## My interpretation

Because the image to rely on only shows static "desktop" viewport, I designed my own interpretation for the responsive design, dynamic elements and form.  
Also, I tried to keep it closer to the original image as close as I could.  
Images cropped from the original image and used basic photoshop tools to change some colors.

### Libraries in use for this project

- Google fonts: `Alfa Slab One`, `Bebas Neue` and `Montserrat`
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- jQuery (needed for Slick slider)
- Slick slider (served locally - CDN had issues of downtime)
